## About Myself:
I have been working as SAP system administrator for 8 years.  Now I am on maternity leave and I don't want to continue this job. I am like to develop and I want to work in this field. And so I am here for refreshing knoweleges and gaining new ones.


## Skills:
* C#, C++, JS, VBS, Delphi
* MS Visual Studio, VS Code
* Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL
## Code example:
Calculate String Rotation KATA from Codewars:
*Write a function that receives two strings and returns n, where n is equal to the number of characters we should shift the first string forward to match the second. The check should be case sensitive.*

*For instance, take the strings "fatigue" and "tiguefa". In this case, the first string has been rotated 5 characters forward to produce the second string, so 5 would be returned.*

*If the second string isn't a valid rotation of the first string, the method returns -1.*

```javascript
function shiftedDiff(first,second){
     let res=first;
    if (first === second)
    return 0;
    for (let i=1;i<res.length;i++)
    {
        res = res[res.length-1]+res.slice(0,res.length-1);
        if (res ===second)
         return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
